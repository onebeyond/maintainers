## About

One Beyondâ€™s commitment to the open source community encourages an attitude of **collaboration, transparency, and flexibility**; a philosophy that enables developers across the world to fulfil their potential and create ground-breaking software, as well as giving back to the open source community the same value that we receive from it.

This repository is used to coordinate the Open Source Activity and the communications with the community.
