# Tiers

We use tiers to classify the projects in our organization. This classification is used to define the level of support that we provide to each project.

**How this classification will affect the maintainers?**

First of all, the criteria used per tier are not strict, the final decision is made by us as a group and not only by technical criteria. As well some projects are hard to classify like `awesome-*`.

- **Tier 0** will require a lot of support from the `@onebeyond/maintainers` team in order to consolidate the project in our Open Source culture, IT resources, guidance...
- **Tier 1** will require active monitoring from the `@onebeyond/maintainers` and the code owners for security patching, code review priority...
- **Tier 2** will require some work from the code owners per year to keep up with the dependencies, etc...
- **Tier 3** will require some work from the `@onebeyond/maintainers` to deprecate the libraries, remove IT resources and archive the projects.

**When and who decides the project tier?**

The tier is decided by the `@onebeyond/maintainers` team and the code owners. The tier is reviewed every year and the tier can be changed at any time.

## Tier 0: Incubate

The starting point for new projects.

### Criteria:

- The project was created in the last 12 months
- The project didn't release v1.0.0 yet
- The project is not yet following all the guidelines from the org (code, automation, metafiles...)


## Tier 1: Active

The projects that are growing.

### Criteria:

- The project is under active development including business logic evolution (at least one release in the last year).
- The project has a roadmap
- The project is following all the guidelines from the org (code, automation, metafiles...)

### Actions:

- [ ] Create a valid README
- [ ] Create a valid LICENSE
- [ ] Build a clear roadmap and keep it up to date
- [ ] Ensure that the project is correctly set up in GitHub (labels, milestones, projects, permissions, branch protection rules, etc...)

**If the project is a library**
- [ ] Add the project to code climate
- [ ] Add the expected project badges (code coverage, code quality, etc...)
- [ ] Create a valid SECURITY.md or reuse/link to the org one
- [ ] Create a valid CODEOWNERS file and keep it up to date
- [ ] Ensure CI/CD with GitHub Actions (deployments, tests, linting, formatting, coverage, vulnerability, etc...)
- [ ] Ensure quality tools (linting, formatting, coverage, vulnerability, etc...) are passing
- [ ] Use a Semantic Automated Testing Strategy (SATS) to ensure the quality of the project
- [ ] Add OpenSSF Scorecard reporting and keep it up to date with a high score (over 7.0)
- [ ] Add OpenSSF Test Coverage reporting and keep it up to date with a high coverage (over 70%)
- [ ] Add automation for issues/PRs and templates
- [ ] Keep your dependencies up to date with Dependabot (or similar)
- [ ] Ensure that the project publishes the package via CI and not from your local devices
- [ ] Ensure that the library is capable of running in a CI/CD environment against a Matrix of version from the supported platforms (Node.js, .NET...)

**If the project has infrastructure**
- [ ] Ensure that the Infra/maintainers team is aware of the project and the project is using the right resources


## Tier 2: Maintenance

The consolidated projects that our community relies on but do not require any active development in terms of business logic.

### Criteria:

- The project is done in terms of business logic but is actively used by the community, so the project Maintenance tasks are mostly updating dependencies and fixing minor bugs.
- The project has completed the roadmap

### Actions:

_same as Tier 1, but focusing on dependencies and bugs rather than roadmap or long-term strategy_


## Tier 3: End Of Life

The projects that are not actively used by the community.

### Criteria:

- The project is considered completed and is not actively used by the community.
- The project has not done any release in the last 3 years.

### Actions:

- [ ] Archive the project in GitHub
- [ ] Close all the pending issues
- [ ] Close all the pending PRs
- [ ] Add a message in the README.md to inform the users that the project is not maintained anymore

**If the project is a library**
- [ ] Add a message in the README.md to inform the users that the project is not maintained anymore and suggest an alternative
- [ ] Add a deprecation notice in the package manager (npm, maven, etc...)

**If the project has infrastructure**
- [ ] Remove/reuse the infra resource (server, domain, etc...)
