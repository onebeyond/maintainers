# January's Newsletter

## üì¢ Announcements and Updates

**üö® Important**

As we achieved a consolidated organization and management of the GitHub organization during 2023, from January 2024, we won't have biweekly catch-ups anymore. We'll keep the monthly newsletter and we'll have on-demand meetings to discuss the organization's health and the open source strategy. Don't hesitate to contact us if you want to discuss anything.
