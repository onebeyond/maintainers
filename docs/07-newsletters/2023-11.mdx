# November's Newsletter

## üì¢ Announcements and Updates

**üö® Important**

We went one step further in the [infrastructure management](https://github.com/onebeyond/org-infra) and we have migrated our teams and users to be managed using Terraform. In the next months, we'll improve the documentation of the repository so you can both learn and create your own PRs to improve it.

**üì∞ News**

- We're evaluating the best approach to publish new releases of our packages in a consistent and homogenized way. You can take a look at [spdx-license-satisfies](https://github.com/onebeyond/spdx-license-satisfies) to see [release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) in action. However, we still need to polish some details, and we're also evaluating other options like [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).

**üôå Participate!**
- **You can sign the [One Beyond Open Source Manifesto](/open-source-manifesto) to show your support**.
- We want to increase the maintainers team. If you are interested please contact us on Slack.
- There are [issues](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aonebeyond+user%3Aguidesmiths+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l=) with the `help wanted` tag. Please feel free to participate.
- Please join us for the upcoming maintainers meeting on November 2nd, 2023!

**üëÄ Repo of the month**

Artificial intelligence is in vogue. In [this repo](https://github.com/abi/screenshot-to-code) you'll find an app that converts a screenshot to HTML/Tailwind CSS. It uses GPT-4 Vision to generate the code and DALL-E 3 to generate similar-looking images. You can even enter a URL to clone a live website!

Give it a try [here](https://picoapps.xyz/free-tools/screenshot-to-code).
