**📰 News**

- October is coming, and with it a new edition of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)! This year they are celebrating their 10th anniversary supporting Open Source! You'll be able to register from the 26th of September.
As you all know, in One Beyond :one-beyond-bw: we try to be an active member in the Open Source ecosystem and we have an Open Source community in GitHub. There you can find a lot of repositories where you can contribute and achieve your digital reward. There are tons of options to help and also learn new stuff:

  - Learn how to terraform the complete infrastructure of a GitHub organization
  - Contribute to our well-known [license-checker](https://github.com/onebeyond/license-checker)
  - Learn and help to release our [first OB GitHub action](https://github.com/onebeyond/license-checker-github-action) so we can use our license-checker from our CI/CD pipelines
  - Improve the notifications we send to slack by adding some new cool stuff to our [bamboohrbot](https://github.com/onebeyond/bamboohrbot)
  - Give some love to our beloved [systemic](https://github.com/onebeyond/systemic)
  - Learn about [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) by integrating it in our repos
  - And much more... Ask the maintainers or in our slack channel if you want to know more!

**🙌 Participate!**
- **You can sign the [One Beyond Open Source Manifesto](/open-source-manifesto) to show your support**.
- We want to increase the maintainers team. If you are interested please contact us on Slack.
- There are [issues](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aonebeyond+user%3Aguidesmiths+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l=) with the `help wanted` tag. Please feel free to participate.

## 📚 Great Resources

<!--- @TODO: Manual addition --->

** 👀 Repo of the month **

From September we'll have this new section to highlight an Open Source repository that we think is worth to mention.

We start with **[this repository](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics)** from [lowlighter](https://github.com/lowlighter). It's a GitHub action that allows you to generate metrics for your GitHub profile, repositories and organizations.

Additionaly, it has a nice [tool](https://metrics.lecoq.io/) to generate a `README` file with your metrics. Take a look at it and start using it in your repositories!
