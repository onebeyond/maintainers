# October's Newsletter

## üì¢ Announcements and Updates

**üö® Important**

We went one step further in the [infrastructure management](https://github.com/onebeyond/org-infra) and we have migrated our teams and users to be managed using Terraform. In the next months, we'll improve the documentation of the repository so you can both learn and create your own PRs to improve it.

**üì∞ News**

- October is coming to an end, so it's time to check if you were able to complete the Hacktoberfest challenge [here](https://hacktoberfest.com/profile/). If you haven't, don't worry, you still have a few days left to complete it.

- We're also evaluating the best approach to publish new releases of our packages in a consistent and homogenized way. You can take a look at [spdx-license-satisfies](https://github.com/onebeyond/spdx-license-satisfies) to see [release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) in action. However, we still need to polish some details, and we're also evaluating other options like [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).

**üôå Participate!**
- **You can sign the [One Beyond Open Source Manifesto](/open-source-manifesto) to show your support**.
- We want to increase the maintainers team. If you are interested please contact us on Slack.
- There are [issues](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aonebeyond+user%3Aguidesmiths+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l=) with the `help wanted` tag. Please feel free to participate.
- Please join us for the upcoming maintainers meeting on November 2nd, 2023!

**üëÄ Repo of the month**

This month we suggest you [web-check](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check). It allows you to get an insight into the inner-workings of a given website: uncover potential attack vectors, analyse server architecture, view security configurations, and learn what technologies a site is using.

You can see the report of any website by entering it [here](https://web-check.xyz/).
