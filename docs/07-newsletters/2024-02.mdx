**üëÄ Repo of the month**


[SQLFlow](https://github.com/sqlparser/sqlflow_public?tab=readme-ov-file) is a tool that tracks column-level data lineage for more than 20 major databases. It presents a nice clean graph to you that tells where the data came from, what transformations it underwent along the way, and what other data items are derived from this data value. 

It also has a [website](https://sqlflow.gudusoft.com/#/) to explore lineage using an interactive diagram.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Diversity in Tech

Do you know [the A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/)? It is a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier. They have [tons of resources](https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/) in their website if you're interested in this topic.
