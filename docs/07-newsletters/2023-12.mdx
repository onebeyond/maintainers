# December's Newsletter

## üì¢ Announcements and Updates

**üö® Important**

As we achieved a consolidated organization and management of the GitHub organization during 2023, from January 2024, we won't have biweekly catch-ups anymore. We'll keep the monthly newsletter and we'll have on-demand meetings to discuss the organization's health and the open source strategy. Don't hesitate to contact us if you want to discuss anything.

**üì∞ News**

Two new Github actions have been added in the [infrastructure management](https://github.com/onebeyond/org-infra) to control the changes made in Terraform in the PRs and subsequent merge. This will help anyone to review any change made to our GitHub organization settings before applying them.

On the other side, you can finally give a try to the fantastic [Shield.js project](https://github.com/onebeyond/shieldjs). It provides a comprehensive set of frontend tools that every developer uses on a daily basis. Leaving aside the tedious procedure of installing the same tools over and over again, with Shield.js the developer will find a lot of the necessary packages once the installation process is finished. Take a look at its [documentation](https://onebeyond.github.io/shieldjs/).

**üôå Participate!**
- **You can sign the [One Beyond Open Source Manifesto](/open-source-manifesto) to show your support**.
- We want to increase the maintainers team. If you are interested please contact us on Slack.
- There are [issues](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aonebeyond+user%3Aguidesmiths+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l=) with the `help wanted` tag. Please feel free to participate.
