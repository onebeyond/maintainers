# Slack 

We use slack to discuss about the projects and coordinate activities related to them. We follow [the same CoC](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/4) as in Github.

Right now, slack is used to improve the communication between the maintainers. If you need access, please create an issue in this repo.
