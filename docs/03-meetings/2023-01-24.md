## Agenda


### Repo template as baseline
- [See #1](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/1)
- Added CoC at [the organization level](https://github.com/onebeyond/.github/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Other [health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types) in progress 
- We might want to include some Security basic with sample pipelines like [OpenSSF scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/)

### Prototype Pollution in JSON5 via Parse Method 
- [See #21](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/21)
- Ulises doesn't have time, so Iñigo will lead the initiative
- Let's take into account if that vulnerability affects us (directly at all)


### Recover bot account 
- [See #22](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/22)
- Ulises is leading the initiative
- Currently NPM is the major challenge
- Github and inbox were fully recovered already

### Create a secrets management repository 
- [See #30](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/30)
- Ulises leading the initiative. 
- Ulises will create a POC repo and prepare a demo to the team, then we will decide if we adopt it

### Repos with NPM version mismatch 
- [See #29](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/29)
- Mismatch due to manual releases in the past. Still patching them
- Open for collaboration (please comment in the issue if you are interested)

### Missing NPM Package publication permissions 
- [See #28](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/28)
- Contact people in charge of those repos
- Open for collaboration (please comment in the issue if you are interested)

### Unify licenses in Repositories 
- [See #27](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/27)
- Ulises has been reviewing the licenses in all the repositories and most of them have been patched, but he needs to re-patch to include the license periods for different authors

### Initiatives for 2023 
- [See #20](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/20)
- We need to involve more people (let's make some noise in Slack)
- New initiative: Deprecating some packages that nobody uses?
- New initiative: Integrate changes made in forks from some clients and integrate them in the meetings too.

## Q&A, Other
- Let's finish what we're working on before starting new things
- Change meetings frequency to every 2 weeks, and updates by slack

## Upcoming Meetings

- In two weeks!
