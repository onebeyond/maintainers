## Announcements

We have a new website for maintainers! [see](https://onebeyond-maintainers.netlify.app/)

## Agenda

### Repo template as baseline
- [See #1](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/1)
- Iñigo has implemented new templates for Issues and PRs, but it will require some extra work to make it work as organization template (templates location)

### Repos with NPM version mismatch 
- [See #29](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/29)
- No news

### Missing NPM Package publication permissions 
- [See #28](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/28)
- It will be removed from the agenda as it is not a blocker
- The current repositories will be migrated to the new Npm org

### OpenSSF Scorecard implementation
- [See #41](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/41)
- Ulises has created a [Github action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openssf-scorecard-monitor)
- Next version (potentially next week - as beta) will auto-scope the orgs repos and won't require any effort to maintain it.
- Once new version is released, Ulises will create a PR with the implementation for One Beyond org in the maintainers repo.
- It will potentially require some extra PRs to proactively notificate the new scores to the OpenSSF API.


## Q&A, Other

- Potential plan to Move systemic extension a mono-repo
  - We don’t have a full agreement on the need to move for mono-repo approach in the group
  - We will need to research about this topic to consolidate a proper discussion (changelogs, git history migration, etc...)
- Github API research
  - Iñigo has lead an investigation about the capabilities in the Github Api about to check for configurations in the repos (like branch protection) and seems promising. 
  - We have many options on how to deploy the checks (script, github action, npx library...)
- Continuous integration in the systemic-Azure-bus
  - Betisman confirmed that the tests are depending on a third party infra and they are not available.
  - Action: We need to move this to our own infra (Lead by Bestiman)
  - Additional action: Evaluate how hard will be to get rid of external infra to run the tests in CI (mocking, docker..) 

## Upcoming Meetings

- Same as usual, in two weeks same slot
