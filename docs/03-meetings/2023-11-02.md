## Announcements

- Some improvements done to the org-infra in [this PR](https://github.com/onebeyond/org-infra/pull/41)

## Agenda

### FEATURE: Release drafter 
- [See #58](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/58)
- Íñigo has finished the testing of the release-drafter action in [this repository](https://github.com/onebeyond/spdx-license-satisfies)
- His conclusion is that even if he prefers this action on how the release is created as a draft release without having to create a PR (as the release-please does), it has a big problem because this action doesn’t take care of bumping the package.json version. This is a problem because it means that the GitHub release and the npm release may be different and the package.json version needs to be bumped manually
- Íñigo will keep investigating how to solve this and also give a try to [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)

### FEATURE: integrate OSS Check to display Code Climate insights 
- [See #135](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/135)
- We didn’t have time to investigate this yet


### FEATURE: spread agnostic content for org-infra
- [See #147](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/147)
- Right now [the repo](https://github.com/onebeyond/org-infra/tree/main) that manages the GitHub infrastructure stores general logic to Terraform a GitHub organisation and specific values for the OB organisation. It would be a good idea to decouple them so any organization can use the first part.
- Àlex suggests moving the OB specific data to a different repository and create a gitsubmodule



### FEATURE: dependabot user-defined rules 
- [See #149](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/149)
- GitHub now allows to do dependabot fine-grain configuration. Even if the Terraform GitHub provider doesn’t support this feature, we could configure and benefit from it using the GitHub user interface.

### FEATURE: add repositories custom properties 
- [See #150](https://github.com/onebeyond/admin/issues/150)
- GitHub now allows to do dependabot fine-grain configuration. Even if the Terraform GitHub provider doesn’t support this feature, we could configure and benefit from it using the GitHub user interface for things such as the tier each repository belongs to (the `tier` property has already been created for testing purposes).

## Q&A, Other


## Upcoming Meetings
- The next meeting will be in 2 weeks (16th November  2023)
