# Team Management

The access level to any repository is managed by teams.

## Current teams

There are many teams inside the Github organization. Each team has a clear scope and access level to certain repositories.

### Organic teams

- `@onebeyond/admins`: [Organization Owners](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-owners).
- `@onebeyond/maintainers`: [Admin level](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#repository-roles-for-organizations) to all the repositories in the Org
- `@onebeyond/triage`: [Triage level](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#repository-roles-for-organizations) to all the repositories in the Org


### Specific teams

Some projects have specific teams with write access to certain repositories, for example `@onebeyond/systemic` that grants [write level access](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#repository-roles-for-organizations) to all the repositories related to systemic ecosystem.
